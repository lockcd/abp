In the previous part, we've created a new microservice named Catalog. In this part, we will build functionality to create and manage products in our system.

In this part, we will use [ABP Suite](../../suite/index.md) to automatically create all the necessary code for us. So, you will see how to use ABP Suite in a microservice solution. We will do everything manually while we will create the Ordering microservice in next parts, so you will learn the details better. We suggest to use ABP Suite wherever it is possible, because it saves a lot of time. You can then investigate the changes done by ABP Suite to understand what it produced.

## Opening the ABP Suite

First of all, **stop all the applications** in ABP Studio's *Solution Runner* panel, because ABP Suite will make changes in the solution and it will also needs to build the solution in some steps. Running the solution prevents to build it.

Now, select the *ABP Suite* -> *Open* command on the main menu to open ABP Suite:

![abp-studio-open-abp-suite](images/abp-studio-open-abp-suite-dark.png)

It will ask to you which module you want to use:

![abp-studio-open-abp-suite-select-module](images/abp-studio-open-abp-suite-select-module-dark.png)

The `CloudCrm` microservice solution contains more than one .NET solution. Typically, each ABP Studio module represents a separate .NET solution (see the [concepts](../../studio/concepts.md) document). ABP Suite works on a single .NET solution to generate code, so we should select a module here.

Select the `CloudCrm.CatalogService` module and click the *OK* button. It will open ABP Suite as shown below:

![abp-studio-abp-suite-inside](images/abp-studio-abp-suite-inside-dark.png)

## Generating a Products Page

In the next section, we will use ABP Suite to create a fully functional CRUD page with ABP Suite. The UI part will be in the main web application (`{{if UI == "MVC"}} `CloudCrm.Web` {{else if UI == "BlazorServer" || UI == "Blazor" || UI == "BlazorWebApp"}} `CloudCrm.Blazor` {{else}} `Angular` {{end}}`) and the application service and other parts will be generated in the Catalog microservice.

### Configuring the Product Entity Information

Type `Product` for the *Name* field and leave the other options as is. ABP Suite will automatically calculate proper values for you:

![abp-suite-product-info](images/abp-suite-product-info.png)

### Configuring Properties of the Product Entity

Open the *Properties* tab and create the properties shown in the following figure:

![abp-suite-product-properties](images/abp-suite-product-properties.png)

Here the details:

* `Name` is required, minimum length is `2` and maximum length is `120`.
* `Description` is not required, it is a *Text area*, not *Filterable*, not *Shown on the list page*.
* `StockCount` has a *Default value* `0`, minimum value `0` and maximum value `999999`.
* `ReleaseDate` is *Nullable*.

You can leave the other configurations as default.

### Generating the Code

![abp-suite-product-generating.png](images/abp-suite-product-generating.png)

That's all. You can click the *Save and generate* button to start the code generation process.

![abp-suite-product-generated](images/abp-suite-product-generated.png)

ABP Suite will generate the necessary code for you. It will take some time to complete the process. After the process is completed, you will see a success message, click the *OK* button.

![abp-studio-catalog-service-build-and-start](images/abp-studio-catalog-service-start-dark.png)

We can now start the `CloudCrm.CatalogService` application by clicking the *Start* button (or alternatively, directly clicking the *run* icon) in the *Solution Runner* panel.

![abp-studio-browse-catalog-service-2](images/abp-studio-browse-catalog-service-2.png)

After the application is started, you can right-click and [Browse](../../studio/running-applications.md#monitoring) on the `CloudCrm.CatalogService` application to open it in the ABP Studio's pre-integrated browser. You can see the *Products* controller in the Swagger UI.

{{if UI == "NG"}}
### Generating the UI Proxy

ABP Suite automatically generates the UI proxy for the `Angular` project. If you want to create manually, run this command under the `Angular` project folder:

```bash
abp generate-proxy -t ng -m catalog -u http://localhost:44384 --target catalog-service
```

For more information, please refer to the [Service Proxies](https://abp.io/docs/latest/framework/ui/angular/service-proxies) documentation.
{{end}}

{{if UI == "MVC" || UI == "Blazor" || UI == "BlazorServer" || UI == "BlazorWebApp"}}
### Generating the UI Proxy

{{if UI == "BlazorWebApp"}}

Now, we need to generate the [Static API Proxy](../../framework/api-development/static-csharp-clients.md) for the UI project. Since we are using `BlazorWebApp`, we will generate client proxies in both the `CloudCrm.Blazor` and `CloudCrm.Blazor.Client` projects, as pages are sometimes rendered on the server side and sometimes on the client side.

#### For the Server Project
![abp-studio-generate-proxy-blazor-server](images/abp-studio-generate-proxy-blazor-webapp-server-dark.png)

This will open the Generate C# Proxies window. Select the `CloudCrm.CatalogService` application this will automatically fill in the *URL* field. Next, choose the catalog module, set the service type to *Application*, and check the *Without contracts* option, since the `CloudCrm.Blazor` project already references the `CloudCrm.CatalogService.Contracts` package.

#### For client project
![abp-studio-generate-proxy-blazor](images/abp-studio-generate-proxy-blazor-dark.png)

This will open the Generate C# Proxies window. Select the `CloudCrm.CatalogService` application this will automatically fill in the *URL* field. Next, choose the catalog module, set the service type to *Application*, and check the *Without contracts* option, since the `CloudCrm.Blazor.Client` project already references the `CloudCrm.CatalogService.Contracts` package.

{{else}}

Now, we need to generate the [Static API Proxy](../../framework/api-development/static-csharp-clients.md) for the UI project. Right-click the {{if UI == "MVC"}} `CloudCrm.Web` {{else if UI == "BlazorServer"}} `CloudCrm.Blazor` {{else if UI == "Blazor"}} `CloudCrm.Blazor.Client` {{end}} [package](../../studio/concepts.md#package) and select the *ABP CLI* -> *Generate Proxy* -> *C#* command:

{{if UI == "MVC"}}
![abp-studio-generate-proxy](images/abp-studio-generate-proxy-dark.png)
{{else if UI == "BlazorServer"}}
![abp-studio-generate-proxy-blazor-server](images/abp-studio-generate-proxy-blazor-server-dark.png)
{{else if UI == "Blazor"}}
![abp-studio-generate-proxy-blazor](images/abp-studio-generate-proxy-blazor-dark.png)
{{end}}

{{end}}

It will open the *Generate C# Proxies* window. Select the `CloudCrm.CatalogService` application, and it will automatically populate the *URL* field. Select the *catalog* module, set the service type to *application*, and check the *Without contracts* checkbox, as the {{if UI == "MVC"}} `CloudCrm.Web` {{else}} `CloudCrm.Blazor` {{end}}  project already depends on the `CloudCrm.CatalogService.Contracts` package:

![abp-studio-generate-proxy-window](images/abp-studio-generate-proxy-window-dark.png)

> To be able to select the *Application*, you must *Start* the related application beforehand. You can start the application using [Solution Runner](../../studio/running-applications.md) as explained in the previous parts.

{{end}}


### Running the Application

Now, stop any application running in the *Solution Runner* panel, and then run the applications by clicking the *Start All* button on the root item in the *Solution Runner* panel:

![abp-studio-run-build-and-start-all](images/abp-studio-run-start-all-dark.png)

After the application is started, you can right-click and [Browse](../../studio/running-applications.md#monitoring) on the {{if UI == "MVC"}} `CloudCrm.Web` {{else if UI == "NG"}} `CloudCrm.Angular` {{else}} `CloudCrm.Blazor` {{end}} application to open it in the ABP Studio's pre-integrated browser:

![abp-studio-browse-cloud-crm-products](images/abp-studio-browse-cloud-crm-products.png)

> If you can't see the *Products* menu item, you need to grant the `CatalogService` *Product* permission to the *admin* role. You can do this by navigating to *Identity Management* -> *Roles* and editing the *admin* role. Alternatively, you can restart the *CloudCrm.AdministrationService* application to automatically seed all permissions for the *admin* role.

> When we create `Catalog` microservice, the `CatalogService` API scope is also created automatically if the "Enable integration" option is selected. You can verify the new scope in the `CloudCrm.IdentityService` module (.NET solution), in the `CloudCrm.IdentityService` project within the `OpenIddictDataSeeder` class's `CreateApiScopesAsync` method. If you are already logged in to the application, you may need to log out and log back in to reauthorize with the newly created API scope.

You can open the Sql Server Management Studio to see the created tables and data:

## Summary

In this part, we've created a new entity named *Product* and generated the necessary code for it. We've also generated the UI proxy for the `CatalogService` application and configured the static HTTP client for it in the {{if UI == "MVC"}} `CloudCrm.Web` {{else if UI == "BlazorServer"}} `CloudCrm.Blazor` {{else}} `CloudCrm.Blazor.Client` {{end}} project. We've run the application and tested the *Products* page.
