  }
}
````

In the [previous part](part-04), you created Ordering module and installed it into the main application. However, the Ordering module has no functionality yet. In this part, you will create an `Order` entity and add functionality to create and list the orders.

## Creating an `Order` Entity

Open the `ModularCrm.Ordering` .NET solution in your IDE.

> Tip: You can open the folder of a module's .NET solution by right-clicking the related module in ABP Studio and selecting the *Open with* -> *Explorer* command.

### Adding an `Order` Class

Create an `Order` class to the `ModularCrm.Ordering` project:

````csharp
using System;
using Volo.Abp.Domain.Entities.Auditing;

namespace ModularCrm.Ordering;

public class Order : CreationAuditedAggregateRoot<Guid>
{
    public Guid ProductId { get; set; }
    public string CustomerName { get; set; } = null!;
    public OrderState State { get; set; }
}
````

We allow users to place only a single product within an order. The `Order` entity would be much more complex in a real-world application. However, the complexity of the `Order` entity doesn't affect modularity. So, we keep it simple to focus on modularity in this tutorial. We are inheriting from the [`CreationAuditedAggregateRoot` class](../../framework/architecture/domain-driven-design/entities.md) since I want to know when an order has been created and who has created it.

### Adding an `OrderState` Enumeration

We used an `OrderState` enumeration that has not yet been defined. Create a `OrderState.cs` file inside the `ModularCrm.Ordering.Contracts` project and define the following Enum:

````csharp
namespace ModularCrm.Ordering;

public enum OrderState : byte
{
    Placed = 0,
    Delivered = 1,
    Canceled = 2
}
````

The final structure of the Ordering module should be similar to the following figure in your IDE:

![visual-studio-order-entity](images/visual-studio-order-entity-v2.png)

## Configuring the Database Mapping

The `Order` entity has been created. Now, you need to configure the database mapping for that entity. You will first define the database table mapping, create a database migration and update the database.

### Defining the Database Mappings

Entity Framework Core requires defining a `DbContext` class as the main object for the database mapping. We want to use the main application's `DbContext` object. That way, you can control the database migrations at a single point, ensure database transactions on multi-module operations, and establish relations between database tables of different modules. However, the Ordering module can not use the main application's `DbContext` object because it doesn't depend on the main application, and you don't want to establish such a dependency.

As a solution, you will use `DbContext` interface in the Ordering module which is then implemented by the main module's `DbContext`.

Open your IDE, in `Data` folder under the `ModularCrm.Ordering` project, and edit `IOrderingDbContext` interface as shown:

````csharp
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using Volo.Abp.Data;
using Volo.Abp.EntityFrameworkCore;

namespace ModularCrm.Ordering.Data;

[ConnectionStringName(OrderingDbProperties.ConnectionStringName)]
public interface IOrderingDbContext : IEfCoreDbContext
{
    DbSet<Order> Orders { get; set; }
}
````

Afterwards, create *Orders* `DbSet` for the `OrderingDbContext` class in the `Data` folder under the `ModularCrm.Ordering` project:

````csharp
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using Volo.Abp.Data;
using Volo.Abp.EntityFrameworkCore;

namespace ModularCrm.Ordering.Data;

[ConnectionStringName(OrderingDbProperties.ConnectionStringName)]
public class OrderingDbContext : AbpDbContext<OrderingDbContext>, IOrderingDbContext
{
    public DbSet<Order> Orders { get; set; }

    public OrderingDbContext(DbContextOptions<OrderingDbContext> options)
        : base(options)
    {

    }

    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder builder)
    {
        base.OnModelCreating(builder);

        builder.ConfigureOrdering();
    }
}
````

You can inject and use the `IOrderingDbContext` in the Ordering module. However, you will not usually directly use that interface. Instead, you will use ABP's [repositories](../../framework/architecture/domain-driven-design/repositories.md), which internally uses that interface.

It is best to configure the database table mapping for the `Order` entity in the Ordering module. You will use the `OrderingDbContextModelCreatingExtensions` in the same `Data` folder:

````csharp
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using Volo.Abp;
using Volo.Abp.EntityFrameworkCore.Modeling;

namespace ModularCrm.Ordering.Data;

public static class OrderingDbContextModelCreatingExtensions
{
    public static void ConfigureOrdering(
        this ModelBuilder builder)
    {
        Check.NotNull(builder, nameof(builder));

        builder.Entity<Order>(b =>
        {
            //Configure table name
            b.ToTable(OrderingDbProperties.DbTablePrefix + "Orders", 
                      OrderingDbProperties.DbSchema);

            //Always call this method to set base entity properties
            b.ConfigureByConvention();

            //Properties of the entity
            b.Property(q => q.CustomerName).IsRequired().HasMaxLength(120);
        });
    }
}
````

#### Configuring the Main Application

Open the main application's solution in your IDE, find the `ModularCrmDbContext` class under the `ModularCrm` project's `Data` folder, and follow the 3 steps below:

**(1)** Add the following attribute on top of the `ModularCrmDbContext` class:

````csharp
[ReplaceDbContext(typeof(IOrderingDbContext))]
````

The `ReplaceDbContext` attribute allows the use of the `ModularCrmDbContext` class in the services in the Ordering module.

**(2)** Implement the `IOrderingDbContext` by the `ModularCrmDbContext` class:

````csharp
public class ModularCrmDbContext :
    AbpDbContext<ModularCrmDbContext>,
    ICatalogDbContext,
    IOrderingDbContext //NEW: IMPLEMENT THE INTERFACE
{
    public DbSet<Product> Products { get; set; }
    public DbSet<Order> Orders { get; set; } //NEW: ADD DBSET PROPERTY
	...
}
````

**(3)** Finally, ensure that the `ConfigureOrdering()` extension method is called inside the `OnModelCreating` method (this should already be done from ABP Studio):

````csharp
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder builder)
{
    ...
    builder.ConfigureOrdering();
}
````

In this way, the Ordering module can use `ModularCrmDbContext` over the `IOrderingDbContext` interface. This part is only needed once for a module. Next time, you can add a new database migration, as explained in the next section.

#### Add a Database Migration

Now, you can add a new database migration. You can use Entity Framework Core's `Add-Migration` (or `dotnet ef migrations add`) terminal command, but in this tutorial, you will use ABP Studio's shortcut UI.

Ensure that the solution has built. You can right-click the `ModularCrm` (under the `main` folder) on ABP Studio *Solution Runner* and select the *Dotnet CLI* -> *Graph Build* command.

Right-click the `ModularCrm` package and select the *EF Core CLI* -> *Add Migration* command:

![abp-studio-add-entity-framework-core-migration](images/abp-studio-add-entity-framework-core-migration.png)

The *Add Migration* command opens a new dialog to get a migration name:

![abp-studio-entity-framework-core-add-migration-order](images/abp-studio-entity-framework-core-add-migration-order-v2.png)

Once you click the *OK* button, a new database migration class is added to the `Migrations` folder of the `ModularCrm` project:

![visual-studio-new-migration-class-2](images/visual-studio-new-migration-class-2-v2.png)

Now, you can return to ABP Studio, right-click the `ModularCrm` project and select the *EF Core CLI* -> *Update Database* command:

![abp-studio-entity-framework-core-update-database](images/abp-studio-entity-framework-core-update-database.png)

After the operation completes, you can check your database to see the new `OrderingOrders` table has been created:

![sql-server-products-database-table](images/sql-server-orders-database-table-v2.png)

`Ordering` prefix is added to all table names of the Ordering module. If you want to change or remove it, see the `OrderingDbProperties` class in the Ordering module's .NET solution.

## Creating the Application Service

You will create an application service to manage the `Order` entities. 

### Defining the Application Service Contract

You're gonna create the `IOrderAppService` interface under the `ModularCrm.Ordering.Contracts` project. Return to your IDE, open the `ModularCrm.Ordering` module's .NET solution and create an `IOrderAppService` interface in the `ModularCrm.Ordering.Contracts` project:

````csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Volo.Abp.Application.Services;

namespace ModularCrm.Ordering;

public interface IOrderAppService : IApplicationService
{
    Task<List<OrderDto>> GetListAsync();
    Task CreateAsync(OrderCreationDto input);
}
````

### Defining Data Transfer Objects

The `GetListAsync` and `CreateAsync` methods will use data transfer objects (DTOs) to communicate with the client. You will create two DTO classes for that purpose.

Create a `OrderCreationDto` class under the `ModularCrm.Ordering.Contracts` project:

````csharp
using System;
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;

namespace ModularCrm.Ordering;

public class OrderCreationDto
{
    [Required]
    [StringLength(150)]
    public string CustomerName { get; set; } = null!;

    [Required]
    public Guid ProductId { get; set; }
}
````

Create a `OrderDto` class under the `ModularCrm.Ordering.Contracts` project:

````csharp
using System;

namespace ModularCrm.Ordering;

public class OrderDto
{
    public Guid Id { get; set; }
    public string CustomerName { get; set; } = null!;
    public Guid ProductId { get; set; }
    public OrderState State { get; set; }
}
````

The new files under the `ModularCrm.Ordering.Contracts` project should be like the following figure:

![visual-studio-ordering-contracts](images/visual-studio-ordering-contracts-v2.png)

### Implementing the Application Service

First we configure the *AutoMapper* to map the `Order` entity to the `OrderDto` object, because we will need it later. Open the `OrderingAutoMapperProfile` under the `ModularCrm.Ordering` project:

````csharp
using AutoMapper;

namespace ModularCrm.Ordering;

public class OrderingAutoMapperProfile : Profile
{
    public OrderingAutoMapperProfile()
    {
        CreateMap<Order, OrderDto>();
    }
}
````

Now, you can implement the `IOrderAppService` interface. Create an `OrderAppService` class under the `ModularCrm.Ordering` project:

````csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Volo.Abp.Domain.Repositories;

namespace ModularCrm.Ordering;

public class OrderAppService : OrderingAppService, IOrderAppService
{
    private readonly IRepository<Order, Guid> _orderRepository;

    public OrderAppService(IRepository<Order, Guid> orderRepository)
    {
        _orderRepository = orderRepository;
    }

    public async Task<List<OrderDto>> GetListAsync()
    {
        var orders = await _orderRepository.GetListAsync();
        return ObjectMapper.Map<List<Order>, List<OrderDto>>(orders);
    }

    public async Task CreateAsync(OrderCreationDto input)
    {
        var order = new Order
        {
            CustomerName = input.CustomerName,
            ProductId = input.ProductId,
            State = OrderState.Placed
        };

        await _orderRepository.InsertAsync(order);
    }
}
````

### Exposing Application Services as HTTP API Controllers

After implementing the application service, we can create HTTP API endpoints for the ordering module using the ABP's [Auto API Controllers](../../framework/api-development/auto-controllers.md) feature. For that purpose, open the `OrderingModule` class in the Ordering module's .NET solution (the `ModularCrm.Ordering` solution), find the `ConfigureServices` method and add the following lines inside that method:

````csharp
Configure<AbpAspNetCoreMvcOptions>(options =>
{
    options.ConventionalControllers.Create(typeof(OrderingModule).Assembly, settings =>
    {
        settings.RootPath = "ordering";
    });
});
````

This will tell the ABP framework to create API controllers for the application services in the `ModularCrm.Ordering` assembly.

### Creating Example Orders

This section will create a few example orders using the [Swagger UI](../../framework/api-development/swagger.md). Thus, you will have some sample orders to show on the UI.

Open the Solution Runner panel and click the *Play* button near the solution root. Once the `ModularCrm` application runs, you can right-click it and select the *Browse* command to open the user interface.

Once you see the user interface of the web application, type `/swagger` at the end of the URL to open the Swagger UI. If you scroll down, you should see the `Order` API:

![abp-studio-ordering-swagger-ui-in-browser](images/abp-studio-ordering-swagger-ui-in-browser-v2.png)

> If you don't see the Order API, you may need to re-build the entire solution. Right-click the `ModularCrm` under the `main` folder in the ABP Studio Solution Explorer panel and select the *Dotnet CLI* -> *Graph Build* command. This will ensure that all the modules and the main application are completely built.

Expand the `POST /api/ordering/order` API and click the *Try it out* button. Then, create a few orders by filling in the request body and clicking the *Execute* button:

![abp-studio-swagger-ui-create-order-execute](images/abp-studio-swagger-ui-create-order-execute-v2.png)

If you check the database, you should see the entities created in the *Orders* table:

![sql-server-orders-database-table-filled](images/sql-server-orders-database-table-filled-v2.png)

## Creating the User Interface

In this section, you will create a very simple user interface to demonstrate how to build UI in the catalog module and make it work in the main application.

As a first step, you can stop the application on ABP Studio's Solution Runner if it is currently running.

### Creating the Orders Page

Replace the `Index.cshtml.cs` content in the `Pages/Ordering` folder of the `ModularCrm.Ordering.UI` project with the following code block:

````csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RazorPages;

namespace ModularCrm.Ordering.UI.Pages.Ordering;

public class IndexModel : PageModel
{
    public List<OrderDto> Orders { get; set; }

    private readonly IOrderAppService _orderAppService;

    public IndexModel(IOrderAppService orderAppService)
    {
        _orderAppService = orderAppService;
    }

    public async Task OnGetAsync()
    {
        Orders = await _orderAppService.GetListAsync();
    }
}
````

Here, you are injecting `IOrderAppService` to query `Order` entities from the database to show on the page. Open the `Index.cshtml` file and replace the content with the following code block:

````html
@page
@model ModularCrm.Ordering.UI.Pages.Ordering.IndexModel

<h1>Orders</h1>

<abp-card>
    <abp-card-body>
        <abp-list-group>
            @foreach (var order in Model.Orders)
            {
                <abp-list-group-item>
                    <strong>Customer:</strong> @order.CustomerName <br />
                    <strong>Product:</strong> @order.ProductId <br />
                    <strong>State:</strong> @order.State
                </abp-list-group-item>
            }
        </abp-list-group>
    </abp-card-body>
</abp-card>
````

This page shows a list of orders on the UI. You haven't created a UI to create new orders, and we will not do it to keep this tutorial simple. If you want to learn how to create advanced UIs with ABP, please follow the [Book Store tutorial](../book-store/index.md).

### Editing the Menu Item

ABP provides a modular navigation [menu system](../../framework/ui/mvc-razor-pages/navigation-menu.md) where each module can contribute to the main menu dynamically.

Edit the `OrderingMenuContributor` class into the `ModularCrm.Ordering.UI` project:

````csharp
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Volo.Abp.UI.Navigation;

namespace ModularCrm.Ordering.UI.Menus;

public class OrderingMenuContributor : IMenuContributor
{
    public async Task ConfigureMenuAsync(MenuConfigurationContext context)
    {
        if (context.Menu.Name == StandardMenus.Main)
        {
            await ConfigureMainMenuAsync(context);
        }
    }

    private Task ConfigureMainMenuAsync(MenuConfigurationContext context)
    {
        context.Menu.AddItem(
            new ApplicationMenuItem(
                OrderingMenus.Prefix, // Unique menu id
                "Orders", // Menu display text
                "~/Ordering", // URL
                "fa-solid fa-basket-shopping" // Icon CSS class
            )
        );

        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}

````

`OrderingMenuContributor` implements the `IMenuContributor` interface, which forces us to implement the `ConfigureMenuAsync` method. In that method, you can manipulate the menu items (add new menu items, remove existing menu items or change the properties of existing menu items). The `ConfigureMenuAsync` method is executed whenever the menu is rendered on the UI, so you can dynamically decide how to manipulate the menu items.

> You can check the [menu documentation](../../framework/ui/mvc-razor-pages/navigation-menu.md) to learn more about manipulating menu items.

### Building the Application

Now, you will run the application to see the result. Please stop the application if it is already running. Then open the *Solution Runner* panel, right-click the `ModularCrm` application, and select the *Build* -> *Graph Build* command:

![abp-studio-solution-runner-graph-build](images/abp-studio-solution-runner-graph-build.png)

You've performed a graph build since you've made a change on a module, and more than building the main application is needed. *Graph Build* command also builds the depended modules if necessary. Alternatively, you could build the Ordering module first (on ABP Studio or your IDE). This approach can be faster if you have too many modules and you make a change in one of the modules. Now you can run the application by right-clicking the `ModularCrm` application and selecting the *Start* command.

![abp-studio-browser-orders-menu-item](images/abp-studio-browser-orders-menu-item-v2.png)

Great! We can see the list of orders. However, there is a problem: We see Product's GUID ID instead of its name. This is because the Ordering module has no integration with the Catalog module and doesn't have access to Product module's database to perform a JOIN query. We will solve this problem in the [next part](part-06.md).

## Summary

In this part of the *Modular CRM* tutorial, you've built the functionality inside the Ordering module you created in the [previous part](part-04.md). In the [next part](part-06.md), you will work on establishing communication between the Orders module and the Catalog module.
