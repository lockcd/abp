In this first part of this tutorial, we will create a new ABP solution with modularity enabled.

## Getting Started with a new ABP Solution

Follow the *[Get Started](../../get-started/single-layer-web-application.md)* guide to create a single layer web application with the following configuration:

* **Solution name**: `ModularCrm`
* **UI Framework**: ASP.NET Core MVC / Razor Pages
* **Database Provider**: Entity Framework Core

You can select the other options based on your preference but at the **Modularity** step, check the _Setup as a modular solution_ option and add a new **Standard Module** named `ModularCrm.Catalog`:

Since modularity is a key aspect of the ABP Framework, it provides an option to create a modular system from the beginning. Here, you're creating a `ModularCrm.Catalog` module using the *Standard Module* template.

> **Note:** This tutorial will guide you through creating two modules: `Catalog` and `Ordering`. We've just created the `Catalog` module in the _Modularity_ step. You could also create the `Ordering` module at this stage. However, we'll create the `Ordering` module later in this tutorial to better demonstrate ABP Studio's module management capabilities and to simulate a more realistic development workflow where modules are typically added incrementally as the application evolves.

> **Please complete the [Get Started](../../get-started/single-layer-web-application.md) guide and run the web application before going further.**

## The Solution Structure

The initial solution structure should be like the following in ABP Studio's *[Solution Explorer](../../studio/solution-explorer.md)*:

![solution-explorer-modular-crm-initial-with-modules](images/solution-explorer-modular-crm-initial-with-modules.png)

Initially, you see a `ModularCrm` solution, a `ModularCrm` module under that solution (our main single layer application), and a `modules` folder that contains the `ModularCrm.Catalog` module and its sub .NET projects.

> An ABP Studio module is typically a .NET solution and an ABP Studio solution is an umbrella concept for multiple .NET Solutions (see the [concepts](../../studio/concepts.md) document for more).

The `ModularCrm` module is the core of your application, built as a single-layer ASP.NET Core Web application. On the other hand, the `ModularCrm.Catalog` module consist of four packages (.NET projects) and used to implement the catalog module's functionality.

## Catalog Module's Packages

Here are the .NET projects (ABP Studio packages) of the Catalog module:

- `ModularCrm.Catalog`: The main module project that contains your [entities](../../framework/architecture/domain-driven-design/entities.md), [application service](../../framework/architecture/domain-driven-design/application-services.md) implementations and other business objects
- `ModularCrm.Catalog.Contracts`: Basically contains [application service](../../framework/architecture/domain-driven-design/application-services.md) interfaces and [DTOs](../../framework/architecture/domain-driven-design/data-transfer-objects.md)
- `ModularCrm.Catalog.Tests`: Unit and integration tests (if you selected the _Include Tests_ option)
- `ModularCrm.Catalog.UI`: Contains user interface pages components for the module

## Summary

You've created the initial single layer monolith modular solution with a Catalog module included. In the next part, you will learn how install the Catalog module to the main application.
