# Multi-Tenancy with Separate Databases in .NET and ABP Framework

[Multi-tenancy](https://abp.io/architecture/multi-tenancy) is a common architectural concept for modern SaaS applications, enabling a single application to serve multiple customers (each known as a tenant) while maintaining data isolation, scalability, and operational efficiency. The "Separate database per tenant" approach offers the highest level of data isolation, making it ideal for scenarios with strict data privacy, security, and performance requirements.

In this article, weâ€™ll explore how to use this advanced multi-tenancy model using the powerful capabilities of the ABP Framework and the .NET platform.

> In this article, I will use ABP Studio for creating the application. ABP Studio allows to select "separate database per tenant" option only for [commercial licenses](https://abp.io/pricing).

## Understanding Database Models for a Multi-Tenant Application

In the next sections, I will explain various models for database models of a multi-tenant solution:

* Single (shared) Database Model
* Separate Tenant Databases Model
* Hybrid Multi-Tenant Database Model

Let's start with the first one...

### Single (shared) Database Model

In the shared database model, all the application data stored in a single physical database. In the following diagram, you see different kind of users use the application, and the application stored their data in a main database:

![single-shared-database](single-shared-database.png)

This is the default behavior when you [create a new ABP application](https://abp.io/docs/latest/get-started), because it is simple to begin with and proper for must applications.

In this model, a single database table may contain data of multiple tenants. Each row in these tables have a `TenantId` field which is used to distinguish the tenant data and isolate a tenant's data from other tenant users. To make your entities multi-tenant aware, all you have to do is to implement the `IMultiTenant` interface provided by the ABP Framework.

Here, is an example `Product` entity that should support multi-tenancy:

````csharp
using System;
using Volo.Abp.Domain.Entities;
using Volo.Abp.MultiTenancy;

namespace MtDemoApp
{
    public class Product : AggregateRoot<Guid>, IMultiTenant //Implementing the interface
    {
        public Guid? TenantId { get; set; } //Defined by the IMultiTenant interface
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public float Price { get; set; }
    }
}
````

In this way, ABP Framework automatically isolates data using the `TenantId` property. You don't need to care about how to set `TenantId` or filter data when you need to query from database - all automated.

### Separate Tenant Databases Model

In the separate tenant database model, each tenant has a dedicated physical database (with a separate connection string), as shown below:

![separate-tenant-database-multi-tenancy](separate-tenant-database-multi-tenancy.png)

ABP Framework can automatically select the right database from the current user's tenant context. Again, it is completely automated. You just need to set a connection string for a tenant, as we will do later in this article.

Even each tenant has a separate database, we still need to a main database to store host-side data, like a table of tenants, their connection strings and some other management data for tenants. Also, tenant-independent (or tenant-shared) application data is stored in the main database.

### Hybrid Multi-Tenant Database Model

Lastly, you may want to have a hybrid model, where some tenants shares a single database (they don't have separate databases) but some of them have dedicated databases. In the following figure, Tenant C has its own physical database, but all other tenants data stored in the main database of the application.

![hybrid-database-multi-tenancy](hybrid-database-multi-tenancy.png)

ABP Framework handles the complexity: If a tenant has a separate database it uses that tenant's database, otherwise it filters the tenant data by the `TenantId` field in shared tables.

## Understanding the Separate Tenant Schema Approach

When you create a new ABP solution, it has a single `DbContext` class (for Entity Framework Core) by default. It also includes the necessary EF Core code-first database migrations to create and update the database. As a result of this approach, the main database schema (tables and their fields) will be identical with a tenant database schema. As a drawback of that, tenant databases have some tables that are not meaningful and not used. For example, Tenants table (a list of tenants) will be created in the tenant database, but will never be used (because tenant list is stored in the main database).

As a solution to that problem, ABP Studio provides a "Use separate tenant schema" option on the Multi-Tenancy step of the solution creation wizard:

![separate-tenant-schema-option](separate-tenant-schema-option.png)

This option is only available for the [Layered Monolith (optionally Modular) Solution Template](https://abp.io/docs/latest/get-started/layered-web-application). We don't provide that option in other templates, because:

* [Single-Layer](https://abp.io/docs/latest/get-started/single-layer-web-application) template is recommended for more simpler applications with an easy-to-understand architecture. We don't want to add these kind of complications in that template.
* [Microservice](https://abp.io/docs/latest/get-started/microservice) template already has a separate database for each service. Having multiple database schema (and multiple `DbContext` classes) for each service makes it over complicated without bringing much value.

While you can manually convert your applications so they support separate database schema approach (ABP is flexible), it is not recommended to do it for these solution types.

> Note that "Separate database per tenant" approach is already supported by default for the Single-Layer template too. "Separate tenant schema" is something different as I explained in this section.

## Creating a new Application

Follow the *[Get Started tutorial](https://abp.io/docs/latest/get-started/layered-web-application)* to create a new ABP application. Remember to select the "*Use separate tenant schema*" option since I want to demonstrate it in this article.

## Understanding the DbContext Structure

When you open the solution in your IDE, you will see the following structure under the `.EntityFrameworkCore` project:

![multi-tenancy-dbcontext-structure](multi-tenancy-dbcontext-structure.png)

There are 3 DbContext-related classes here (MtDemoApp is your application name):

* `MtDemoAppDbContext` class is used to map entities for the main (host + shared) database.
* `MtDemoAppTenantDbContext` class is used to map entities for tenant that have separate physical databases.
* `MtDemoAppDbContextBase` is an abstract base class for the classes explained above. In this way, you can configure common mapping logic here.

Let's see these classes a bit closer...

### The Main `DbContext` Class

Here the main `DbContext` class:

````csharp
public class MtDemoAppDbContext : MtDemoAppDbContextBase<MtDemoAppDbContext>
{
    public MtDemoAppDbContext(DbContextOptions<MtDemoAppDbContext> options)
        : base(options)
    {
    }

    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder builder)
    {
        builder.SetMultiTenancySide(MultiTenancySides.Both);

        base.OnModelCreating(builder);
    }
}
````

* It inherits from the `MtDemoAppDbContextBase` as I mentioned before. So, any configuration made in the base class is also valid here.
* `OnModelCreating` overrides the base method and sets the multi-tenancy side as `MultiTenancySides.Both`. `Both` means this database can store host data as well as tenant data. This is needed because we store data in this database for the tenants who don't have a separate database.

### The Tenant `DbContext` class

Here is the tenant-specific `DbContext` class:

````csharp
public class MtDemoAppTenantDbContext : MtDemoAppDbContextBase<MtDemoAppTenantDbContext>
{
    public MtDemoAppTenantDbContext(DbContextOptions<MtDemoAppTenantDbContext> options)
        : base(options)
    {
    }

    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder builder)
    {
        builder.SetMultiTenancySide(MultiTenancySides.Tenant);

        base.OnModelCreating(builder);
    }
}
````

The only difference is that we used `MultiTenancySides.Tenant` as the multi-tenancy side here, since this `DbContext` will only have entities/tables for tenants that have separate databases.

### The Base `DbContext` Class

Here is the base `DbContext` class:

````csharp
public abstract class MtDemoAppDbContextBase<TDbContext> : AbpDbContext<TDbContext>
    where TDbContext : DbContext
{
    
    public MtDemoAppDbContextBase(DbContextOptions<TDbContext> options)
        : base(options)
    {

    }

    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder builder)
    {
        base.OnModelCreating(builder);

        /* Include modules to your migration db context */

        builder.ConfigurePermissionManagement();
        builder.ConfigureSettingManagement();
        builder.ConfigureBackgroundJobs();
        builder.ConfigureAuditLogging();
        builder.ConfigureIdentityPro();
        builder.ConfigureOpenIddictPro();
        builder.ConfigureFeatureManagement();
        builder.ConfigureLanguageManagement();
        builder.ConfigureSaas();
        builder.ConfigureTextTemplateManagement();
        builder.ConfigureBlobStoring();
        builder.ConfigureGdpr();

        /* Configure your own tables/entities inside here */

        //builder.Entity<YourEntity>(b =>
        //{
        //    b.ToTable(MtDemoAppConsts.DbTablePrefix + "YourEntities", MtDemoAppConsts.DbSchema);
        //    b.ConfigureByConvention(); //auto configure for the base class props
        //    //...
        //});

        //if (builder.IsHostDatabase())
        //{
        //    /* Tip: Configure mappings like that for the entities only
               * available in the host side,
        //     * but should not be in the tenant databases. */
        //}
    }
}
````

This `DbContext` class configures database mappings for all the [application modules](https://abp.io/docs/latest/modules) used by this application by calling their extension methods, like `builder.ConfigureBackgroundJobs()`. Each of these extension methods are defined as multi-tenancy aware and care about what you've set for the multi-tenancy side.

### Where to Configure Your Entities?

You can configure your entity mappings in the `OnModelCreating` method in any of the `DbContext` classes that was explained:

* If you configure in the main `DbContext` class, these configuration will be valid only for the main database. So, don't configure tenant-related configuration here, otherwise, it won't be applied for the tenants who have separate databases.
* If you configure in the tenant `DbContext` class, it will be valid only for the tenants with separate databases. You rarely need to do that. You typically want to make same configuration in the base `DbContext` to support hybrid scenarios (some tenants use the main (shared) database and some tenants have separate databases).
* If you configure in the base `DbContext` class, it will be valid for the main database and tenant databases. You typically define tenant-related configuration here. That means, if you have a multi-tenant `Product` entity, then you should define its EF Core database mapping configuration here, so the Products table is created in the main database as well as in the tenant databases.

The recommended approach is to configure all the mapping in the base class, but add controls like `builder.IsHostDatabase()` and `builder.IsTenantDatabase()` to conditionally configure the mappings:

![builder-check-tenant-side](builder-check-tenant-side.png)

## Adding Database Migrations

In this section, I will show how to configure your entity mappings, generate database migrations and apply to the database.

### Defining an Entity

Let's define a `Product` entity in the `.Domain` layer of your application:

````csharp
using System;
using Volo.Abp.Domain.Entities;
using Volo.Abp.MultiTenancy;

namespace MtDemoApp
{
    public class Product : AggregateRoot<Guid>, IMultiTenant
    {
        public Guid? TenantId { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public float Price { get; set; }
    }
}
````

### Configuring the Database Mapping

Open the `MtDemoAppDbContextBase` class and add the following property to the class:

````csharp
public DbSet<Product> Products { get; set; }
````

Then add the following mapping code inside the `OnModelCreating` method (after all other existing code):

````csharp
builder.Entity<Product>(b =>
{
    b.ToTable(MtDemoAppConsts.DbTablePrefix + "Products", MtDemoAppConsts.DbSchema);
    b.ConfigureByConvention(); //auto-configure for the base class props
    b.Property(x => x.Name).IsRequired().HasMaxLength(100);
});
````

We made the configuration in the base class since the `Products` table should be created in all databases, not only in the main database.

>`DbTablePrefix` and `DbSchema` are optional and configurable in your application. You can change or remove them.

### Add a New Database Migration for the Main Database

To add a new EF Core database migration, we can use ABP Studio UI or EF Core command-line commands. I will show both of these approaches here.

#### Using the ABP Studio "Add Migrations" UI

You can right-click the `.EntityFrameworkCore` package in the ABP Studio's *Solution Explorer* panel and select *EF Core CLI* -> *Add Migration* command as shown below:

![abp-studio-add-migration](abp-studio-add-migration.png)

You set a migration name on the opened dialog:

![abp-studio-add-migration-set-name](abp-studio-add-migration-set-name.png)

If you select the *Update Database* checkbox it will apply changes to the database after generating the migration code.

Lastly, select the main DbContext class for this migration:

![abp-studio-add-migration-select-dbcontext](abp-studio-add-migration-select-dbcontext.png)

This dialog is shown when your application has multiple `DbContext` classes. Once you click the *OK* button, a new migration class is added under the `Migrations` folder of the `.EntityFrameworkCore` project (you can see in your coding editor):

![added-product-entity-migration-main-context](added-product-entity-migration-main-context.png)

Since we selected the *Update Database* option, the database table is also created. The following screenshot shows the `AppProducts` table (`App` is the default prefix for your tables, but you can change or remove it) in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio:

![product-database-table](product-database-table.png)

#### Using a Command-Line Terminal

If you prefer to use the command-line terminal (instead of ABP Studio UI), open a command-line terminal in the directory of the `.EntityFrameworkCore` project. As a shortcut, you can right-click the `.EntityFrameworkCore` project in ABP Studio, then select *Open with* -> *Terminal* command as shown in the following figure:

![abp-studio-open-with-terminal](abp-studio-open-with-terminal.png)

Then you can use the [EF Core command-line tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/cli/dotnet) to add a new database migration:

````bash
dotnet ef migrations add "Added_Product_Entity" --context MtDemoAppDbContext
````

It is important to set the `--context` parameter since we have two DbContext classes in the same project.

After adding the migration, you can update the database:

````bash
dotnet ef database update "Added_Product_Entity" --context MtDemoAppDbContext
````

> If you are using Visual Studio, you can also use the [Package Manager Console](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/cli/powershell) inside your IDE to add migrations and update the database.

### Add a New Database Migration for the Tenant Database

We added a database migration for the main (shared) database. We also need to add a new database migration for tenants who have separate databases.

This time, no need to configure the DbContext since we did it in the base DbContext class, so it is valid for both of the DbContext classes. Just right-click the `.EntityFrameworkCore` package in the ABP Studio's *Solution Explorer* panel and select *EF Core CLI* -> *Add Migration* command as shown below:

![abp-studio-add-migration](abp-studio-add-migration.png)

You can set the same or a different migration name here:

![abp-studio-add-migration-set-name](abp-studio-add-migration-set-name.png)

The important part is to select the Tenant DbContext in the next dialog, because we want to change the tenant database this time:

![abp-studio-context-selection](abp-studio-context-selection.png)

After clicking the *OK* button, it will add a new database migration class, but this time to the `TenantMigrations` folder:

![added-product-entity-migration-tenant-context](added-product-entity-migration-tenant-context.png)

ABP Studio is smart enough to select the right folder name for the new migration by mapping with the DbContext name. However, you could manually type `TenantMigrations` in the *Output directory* textbox.

Since we selected the *Update Database* option, it also applied changes to the database. But, which database? Interestingly, it automatically creates a second database for tenants with the project name + `_Tenant` suffix:

![tenant-database](tenant-database.png)

> This new database is never used on runtime or production. It is only created to allow you to see the schema (tables and their fields) on development time to be sure that everything is as expected. As you see, some tables (like `Saas*` and `OpenIddict*`) are not available in that database, since they are used on the host side and only necessary to be in the main database.

You can see that database's connection string in the `appsettings.development.json` file of the `.DbMigrator` project in the solution. If you want to understand how it works, you can check source code of the `DbContextFactory` classes in the `.EntityFrameworkCore` project:

![dbcontext-factories](dbcontext-factories.png)

These factory classes are used to create `DbContext` instances when you execute *Add Migration* and *Update Database* commands.
