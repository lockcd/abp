# Solving MongoDB GUID Issues After an ABP Framework Upgrade

So, you've just upgraded your ABP Framework application to a newer version (like v9.2.0+) and suddenly, your application can't read data from its MongoDB database. You're seeing strange deserialization errors, especially related to `Guid` types. What's going on?

You've likely run into a classic compatibility issue with the MongoDB .NET driver.

### The Problem: Legacy vs. Standard GUIDs

Here's the short version:

* **Old MongoDB Drivers** (used in older ABP versions) stored `Guid` values in a format called `CSharpLegacy`.
* **New MongoDB Drivers** (v3.0+), now default to a universal `Standard` format.

When your newly upgraded app tries to read old data, the new driver expects the `Standard` format but finds `CSharpLegacy`. The byte orders don't match, and... boom. Deserialization fails.

The ABP Framework team has an excellent official guide covering this topic in detail. We highly recommend reading their **[MongoDB Driver 2 to 3 Migration Guide](https://abp.io/docs/latest/release-info/migration-guides/MongoDB-Driver-2-to-3)** for a full understanding.

Our tip below serves as a fast, application-level fix if you need to get your system back online quickly without performing a full data migration.

### The Quick Fix: Tell the Driver to Use the Old Format

Instead of changing your data, you can simply tell the new driver to continue using the old `CSharpLegacy` format for all `Guid` and `Guid?` properties. This provides immediate backward compatibility without touching your database.

Itâ€™s a simple, two-step process.

#### Step 1: Create a Custom Convention

First, create this class in your `.MongoDb` project. It tells the serializer how to handle `Guid` types.

```csharp
using MongoDB.Bson;
using MongoDB.Bson.Serialization;
using MongoDB.Bson.Serialization.Conventions;
using MongoDB.Bson.Serialization.Serializers;
using System;

public class LegacyGuidConvention : ConventionBase, IMemberMapConvention
{
    public void Apply(BsonMemberMap memberMap)
    {
        if (memberMap.MemberType == typeof(Guid))
        {
            memberMap.SetSerializer(new GuidSerializer(GuidRepresentation.CSharpLegacy));
        }
        else if (memberMap.MemberType == typeof(Guid?))
        {
            var guidSerializer = new GuidSerializer(GuidRepresentation.CSharpLegacy);
            var nullableGuidSerializer = new NullableSerializer<Guid>(guidSerializer);
            memberMap.SetSerializer(nullableGuidSerializer);
        }
    }
}
```

#### Step 2: Register the Convention at Startup

Now, register this convention in your `YourProjectMongoDbModule.cs` file. Add this code to the top of the `ConfigureServices` method. This ensures your rule is applied globally as soon as the application starts.

```csharp
using Volo.Abp.Modularity;
using MongoDB.Bson.Serialization;
using MongoDB.Bson.Serialization.Conventions;

public class YourProjectMongoDbModule : AbpModule
{
    public override void ConfigureServices(ServiceConfigurationContext context)
    {
        // Fix Start
        var conventionPack = new ConventionPack { new LegacyGuidConvention() };
        ConventionRegistry.Register(
            "LegacyGuidConvention",
            conventionPack,
            t => true); // Apply to all types
        // Fix End

        // ... Your existing ConfigureServices code
    }
}
```

### An Alternative to Full Data Migration

It's important to note that the method described here is an **application-level fix**. It's a fantastic alternative to performing a full data migration, which involves writing scripts to convert every legacy GUID in your database.

If you are interested in the more permanent, data-centric approach, the ABP.IO community has a detailed guide on [**Migrating MongoDB GUIDs from Legacy to Standard Format**](https://abp.io/community/articles/migrating-mongodb-guids-from-legacy-to-standard-format-mongodb-v2-to-v3-dqwybdtw).

Our quick fix is ideal for getting a system back online fast or when a database migration is too complex. The full migration is better for long-term standards compliance. Choose the path that best fits your project's needs!

### That's It!

Restart your application, and the errors should be gone. Your app can now correctly read its old `Guid` data, and it will continue to write new data in the same legacy format, ensuring consistency.

This approach is a lifesaver for existing projects, saving you from a risky and time-consuming data migration. For brand-new projects, you might consider starting with the `Standard` representation, but for everything else, this is a clean and effective fix. Happy coding!
