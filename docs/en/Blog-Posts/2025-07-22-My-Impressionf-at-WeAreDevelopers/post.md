![Conference Opening](IMG_15924-min.jpg)

After speaking at DotNext Moscow, I had high expectations for WeAreDevelopers 2025‚Äîand the event delivered on all fronts. Held in Berlin / Germany, it brought together a truly global crowd of developers, tech leaders, and innovators. As a speaker and software architect , I‚Äôm sharing my first-hand highlights, favorite moments, and candid scenes from this 2025‚Äôs conference.

## üó£ My Talk

We have a good experience on multi-tenancy topic in SaaS development. My talk's topic was "Building Multi-Tenant ASP.NET Core Applications: Best Practices and Real-World Solutions". It was on the stage 4, 11 July Friday 10:20 am - 10:50 am and [this my presentation file](https://github.com/ebicoglu/presentations/blob/main/multi-tenancy-wearedevelopers-2025_30mins.pptx).

First of all, I had been in numerous software conferences,  I must say that I've never seen such a big software event. The event spanned **500+ sessions across 20+ stages**, including the HR Leaders Summit for **2 full days**.

## üé§ Opening Keynote from GitHub

GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke initiated the conference on the main stage with a talk on *‚ÄúAgents for the Sake of Happiness‚Äù*. Having introduced Copilot three years ago here, he now launched bold predictions about autonomous AI‚Äç‚Äîa fascinating evolution... He demonstrated GitHub Co-Pilot's AI and created a snake game. Altough it didn't work as he planned, we're developers we know live coding is hard. Actually that's because we shouldn't rely on AI. AI is not deterministic even though we set all those temperature, TopP, TopK parameters to minimum.

> AI is a good but not trustable friend!

## üß≠ 11 Parallel Stages: Rush 

There were 11 stages where 11 different topics were being explained. And the sessions were 30 minutes. Actually that's the downside of this event. Because there were so nice talks that needs to be minimum 40 minutes. But anyway I understand the organization team because there are many smart speakers whose needs to be included in this event. So as a attendee I was on a hurry to pick the next talk even when I was listening to a talk :)

The venue consists of 3 buildings. So if you pick a talk on another building, you have 10 mins to go to toilet or drink something and catch the next session on that far building... 

There was HR track with **3 stages and 2 full days** of HR/Talent Acquisition programming, it attracted a notable overlap of developers and HR pros. Themes included AI‚Äëpowered recruiting, remote work culture, mental health, diversity & inclusion, and building AI agents

## ü§ñ AI & AI & AI & Others...

I'm one of those AI lovers. I love learning cutting-edge information. And as I see AI is being more trendy everyday. That's why most of the talks were about AI. Everything related to AI. I generaly attended AI related talks because I'm also working on some AI topics in Volosoft at the moment.

## ü§ù Expo Floor & Networking

The expo was a developer‚Äôs playground‚Äîcloud services, open‚Äësource tools, startups, and enterprise platforms. I found new partners and reconnected with peers in a buzzing atmosphere.  Everywhere was full of talking's even outside. If you want to get fresh air and drink coffee, you can go out and listen to the outside talks.
