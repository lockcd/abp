# Announcing ABP Studio 1.0 Stable Release 🚀

It's the moment you've been waiting for! We are thrilled to announce the stable release of ABP Studio v1.0. This milestone marks a significant step forward in our mission to provide a first-class, integrated development environment for ABP developers. Paired with the recently released [ABP v9.2](https://abp.io/community/articles/announcing-abp-9-2-stable-release-061qmtzb), ABP Studio v1.0 brings new features and improvements that will make your development work faster and more efficient.

For the past several months, our core ABP team has been hard at work, focusing on the features that matter most to you, our community of developers. This release is the peak of that effort, bringing a host of improvements and new capabilities to the forefront. Let's dive in and explore what's new in ABP Studio v1.0.

## What's New with ABP Studio v1.0?

ABP Studio v1.0 is all about enhancing your development experience, from project creation to deployment. Here, we'll walk you through some of the latest features we've implemented, along with other key enhancements that make this release truly special.

### ❤️ Solution Runner with Ready/Health Checks

ABP Studio's Solution Runner now provides visual health monitoring that makes tracking your applications' status easily. When you start an application, a spinner indicates it's "starting", then in the *Overall* tab, you can see the application's health (✅ for healthy, ⚠️ for unhealthy) that displays real-time health status:

![Health Checks](health-checks.png)

With [pre-configured health checks](https://abp.io/docs/9.2/solution-templates/layered-web-application/health-check-configuration) in ABP solution templates including database connectivity tests, you get instant feedback on your applications' health. 

When health check UI is configured, you can access comprehensive health dashboards with a dedicated "Browse Health UI" command or see the last health response from the "Show Latest Health Check Response" command:

When you restart applications that are open in your browser, ABP Studio automatically refreshes the pages for you.

### 🎨 Theme Style Selection on Project Creation

When creating a new solution, you can now choose your theme, theme style, and layout right from the project creation wizard instead of having to configure these settings later. ABP Studio lets you pick from [ABP's officially provided themes including Basic, LeptonX Lite, and LeptonX](https://abp.io/docs/latest/ui-themes).

![Theme Style Selection LeptonX](theme-style-selection-leptonx.png)

If you select Basic or LeptonX Lite themes, only the theme will be changed. However, if you select the LeptonX theme, you'll get additional options to fine-tune your setup:

- **Theme Style Configuration** - Pick from **System, Light, Dim, or Dark** styles to match how you like your development environment 
- **Layout Options** - **Sidebar menu** / **Top menu**

### 📦 "Container" Application Type for Solution Runner

ABP Studio v1.0 introduces a dedicated "Container" application type that gives you better control over your Docker containers directly from the Solution Runner. Instead of managing all your containers through PowerShell scripts or running them all together, you can now see and control each container individually in the Solution Runner panel.

This new feature replaces the previous _Infrastructure_ folder approach with a cleaner, more intuitive container section. You can now:

- **Start and stop containers individually** - No more starting all containers at once when you only need specific services
- **Monitor container status** - See which containers are running, stopped, or have issues directly in the UI
- **Manage container dependencies** - Control the order and timing of container startup based on your application needs

Whether you're working with databases, message brokers, or other containerized services, the new Container application type makes it much easier to manage your development environment. This is especially useful for microservice architectures where you might want to run only specific services during development or testing.

### ⚙️ Handle Multiple DbContexts When Adding/Removing/Applying Migrations

When working with ABP solutions that have multiple DbContexts (such as when using the separate tenant database option), ABP Studio now intelligently prompts you to select the appropriate DbContext for migration operations. This enhancement ensures you're always working with the correct database context and helps prevent common mistakes when managing multiple databases.

The context selection dialog appears automatically when you perform any of these Entity Framework operations:

- **Adding a new migration** - Choose which DbContext the new migration should target
- **Removing an existing migration** - Select the DbContext from which to remove the migration  
- **Updating the database** - Specify which database context should be updated
