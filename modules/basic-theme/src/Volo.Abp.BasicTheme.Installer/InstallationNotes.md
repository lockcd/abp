# Installation Notes for Basic Theme Module (Blazor)

The Basic Theme is a theme implementation for the Blazor UI. It is a minimalist theme that doesn't add any styling on top of the plain [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). You can take the Basic Theme as the base theme and build your own theme or styling on top of it. See the Customization section.
